I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Environemntal Sciencie Policy & Management Department](https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/) of the University of California, Berkeley, affiliated with the [Garbelotto Lab](https://nature.berkeley.edu/matteolab/?page_id=12). I started my Ph.D. in the Fall of 2022 as a Fulbright Scholar. I did my undergraduate and graduate studies at the Univeristy of Florence, Italy obtaining a BS in [Forestry and Environmental Science](https://www.forestambiente.unifi.it/index.html?newlang=eng); an MS [Reception of Migrants: Legislation, Social Integration Policies, and Health Issues](https://www.unifimagazine.it/la-salute-della-popolazione-migrante-parte-uno-studio/); as well as an MS in [Forest System Sciences and Technologies](https://www.forestambiente-magistrale.unifi.it/index.html?newlang=eng). My [research](https://kinoppyi.github.io/edoardo_scali.github.io/research/) interests are Forest and Planth Pathology, with a special emphasis on host-pathogen interactions.
