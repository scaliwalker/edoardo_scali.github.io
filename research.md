_My research investigates plant disease dynamics in forest ecosystems, focusing on fungal pathogens and their interactions with host trees across diverse environmental contexts._

# Research Overview 

> My research covers different aspects of forest pathology, from studying disease processes and interactions within fungal communities to exploring pathogen evolution, with a strong emphasis on statistical methods and computational biology. Focusing on the Cypress Canker Disease pathosystem and using high-throughput dual RNA-seq, I combine ecological, transcriptomic, genomic, and environmental data to clarify mechanisms of disease resistance, community behavior, and evolutionary changes that affect health of forest ecosystems.

# Research Projects

### Doctoral Research

My PhD research focus on the Cypress Canker Disease (CCD) pathosystem. I investigate the interactions between _Seiridium cardinale_ and _Cupressus sempervirens_. Key research questions include:

Which genes are associated with resistance in cypress to CCD?

How does climate affect gene expression during infection?

I use dual-RNA seq to analyze molecular interactions and evaluate how distinct climates influence these dynamics. My experimental setup spans multiple California climate zones, from coastal fog-influenced areas to inland warm Mediterranean climates with hot summers, providing insights on climate-related risks for tree health.
Complementing this, my comparative genomics analyses among _Seiridium_ species explore evolutionary factors underpinning pathogenicity and adaptatiion of invasive populations.

### Molecular Ecology of Fungal Communities

I employ metabarcoding techniques to profile microbial communities in specific environments, with a focus on fungi. By extracting environmental DNA (eDNA), I identify the species that characterize fungal assemblages in a given habitat. In addition to studying airborne fungal communities, I investigate fungi associated with different forest environments by analyzing those inhabiting stem surfaces (caulosphere) and wood substrates.

### Ancient DNA and barcoding of old fungal specimen from herbarium collections

I apply molecular techniques to extract DNA from historical herbarium specimens that often lack sequence data in public repositories. By generating DNA barcodes, I provide valuable genetic information that enhances our understanding of fungal taxonomy and diversity of important fungal species. One of the genus that I work on is _Laccaria_, an important model for the understanding of mycorrhizal association. 

### Development of biocontrol agents

Identifying and developing biological solutions to mitigate fungal diseases in forests.

### Fungal genomics

Contributing to broader fungal genomic projects to uncover genetic bases of fungal adaptation and pathogenicity. The developement of NGS technologies made genomic data production acessible. This alow to understand evolution at a finer scale.
