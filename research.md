_My academic research focusses on the understanding of plant diseases affecting forests and trees. The main pathogens I investigate are fungi._

As a PhD Student, I am examining the interactions between hosts and pathogens, specifically within the Cypress Canker Disease pathosystem. I conduct Dual-RNA sequencing experiments to identify the genes involved in the response to infection and to observe the effects of different climates on infected plants. This aspect is particularly important for understanding how trees respond to diseases when exposed to climate chenages.

# My Research Interests

**Forest Pathology**: Forests are vital ecosystems and are constatly put under pressure by human activityes and changing climates. With my research, I want to understand what is the role of pathogens in this challenging scenario. Climate breakdown and the rampant international trade that facilitates the movement of alien organisms exerting significant pressure on forest health. Consequently, forests are becoming more susceptible to attacks from pathogenic microorganisms.

**Host-Pathogen Interaction**: I study what happens during the infection of a plant by applying dual-RNA seq. When plants and pathogens interact with each other, many factors can influence the outcome of the disease. With my research, I want to understand these processes in the Cypress Canker Disease pathosystem, characterizing the gene expression of resistant and susceptible plants. 

**Fungal Genomics**: Understanding how fungi cause disease is a key aspect of the genomic analyses I conduct in the context of plant pathology. Fungal genomics is a vibrant area of research within which it is possible to answer many questions of biological interest and reveal the secrets of these wonderful organisms. 

**Evolution and Coevolution**: One of the most interesting questions in biology consists of the understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms that lead certain organisms to become pathogens. When this aspect is further expanded, and we consider the reciprocal influence that pathogens and hosts exert on each other's populations. This allows to answer key questions in the context of host-pathogen interaction, providing crucial knowledge for the succesfull management of plant diseases. 

**Computational Biology**: I am a data analysis enthusiast. Since I took my first course on Statistics, I have never stopped coding! I have grown my skills over time and keep learning new computational methods as a passion. I mainly work with [Savio](https://research-it.berkeley.edu/services-projects/high-performance-computing-savio), which is UC Berkeley's computational cluster. 

# Research Projects

## Doctoral Research
My PhD research centers on the Cypress Canker Disease (CCD) pathosystem, investigating interactions between Seiridium cardinale and Cupressus sempervirens. Key research questions include:
- Which genes are associated with resistance in cypress to CCD?
- How does climate affect gene expression during infection?

I employ dual-RNA sequencing to analyze molecular interactions and evaluate how distinct climates influence these dynamics. My experimental setup spans multiple California climate zones, from coastal fog-influenced areas to inland Mediterranean climates with hot summers, providing insights on climate-related risks for tree health.
Complementing this, my comparative genomics analyses among Seiridium species explore evolutionary factors underpinning pathogenicity.

## Molecular ecology of Fungal Communities
Investigating ecological roles, diversity, and dynamics of airborne fungal communities and wood-hinabitant fungal communities.

## Ancient DNA and barcoding of old fungal specimen from herbarium collections 
Applying molecular techniques to understand fungal diversity and historical changes by extracting DNA from old herbarium specimens. 

## Developement of biocontrol agents 
Identifying and developing biological solutions to mitigate fungal diseases in forests.

## Fungal genomics
Contributing to broader fungal genomic projects to uncover genetic bases of fungal adaptation and pathogenicity.
