_My research investigates plant disease dynamics in forest ecosystems, focusing on fungal pathogens and their interactions with host trees._

# Research Overview 

> My research covers different aspects of forest pathology, from studying disease processes and interactions within fungal communities to exploring pathogen evolution, epidemiology of invasive populations, with a strong emphasis on statistical methods and computational biology. I am interestted in understanding host-pathogen interaction in non-model pathosystems. My goal is to produce research that will help sustainable protecioon of forest ecosystems and improvement of forest health.

# Research Projects

### Doctoral Research
My PhD research focus on the Cypress Canker Disease (CCD) pathosystem. I investigate the interactions between _Seiridium cardinale_ and _Cupressus sempervirens_. Despite the fact that CCD is a non-model pathosystem, it is one of the rare example of a pandemic in plant pathology.    

Key research questions that I try to answer include:

_Which genes are associated with resistance in cypress to CCD?_

_How does climate affect gene expression during infection?_

I use dual-RNA seq to analyze molecular interactions and evaluate how distinct climates influence these dynamics. My experimental setup spans multiple California climate zones, from coastal fog-influenced areas to inland warm Mediterranean climates with hot summers, providing insights on climate-related risks for tree health.
Complementing this, my comparative genomics analyses among _Seiridium_ species explore evolutionary factors underpinning pathogenicity and adaptatiion of invasive populations. 

### Molecular Ecology of Fungal Communities
I use metabarcoding techniques to characterize microbial communities in specific environments. By extracting environmental DNA (eDNA), I identify the species that characterize fungal assemblages in a given habitat. I mainly apply this experimental approach to understand the composition of airborne fungal communities, and the fungal communities associated with woody plant tissues that domintaes different forest woodlands. 

### Ancient DNA and barcoding of old fungal specimen from herbarium collections
I apply molecular techniques to extract DNA from historical herbarium specimens that often lack sequence data in genetic data banks. By generating DNA barcodes, I provide valuable genetic information that enhances our understanding of fungal taxonomy and diversity of important fungal species. One of the genus that I work on is _Laccaria_, an important model for the understanding of mycorrhizal association. 

### Genomics
Genomes are powerful tools that can greatly expand our understanding of an organism’s biology. For example, phylogenetic trees built from a few loci often lack the resolution of those based on whole-genome data. Generating high-quality genomes requires obtaining high–molecular-weight DNA, proficiency with multiple sequencing platforms, and mastery of computational methods for assembly and annotation. In my research, I apply these steps to study host–pathogen interactions in the Cypress Canker Disease pathosystem. Because non-model systems frequently lack essential genomic resources, producing reference-quality genomes is critical for addressing scientific questions and testing hypotheses.

### Development of biocontrol agents
The developement of a biocontrol agent is a sustainable approach to pest and disease management. One of the major problem in conifer forest is the impoact of _Heterobasidion_ root rot. This fungus take advantage of cutted stumps, travelling throught the root anastomosis to infect standing trees. 
I am involved in a project that aim to develop an effective biocontrol of _Heterobasidion_ root rot in the West Coast of the United States. We test how different strains of _Phlebiopsis gigantea_ are stopping or reducing the growth of Heterobasidion in cutted stumps.
