_My research investigates plant disease dynamics in forest ecosystems, focusing on fungal pathogens and their interactions with host trees across diverse environmental contexts._

# Research Overview 

> My doctoral research explores how fungal pathogens drive plant disease dynamics in forest ecosystems. I use the Cypress Canker Disease (CCD) pathosystem as a model to understand such interactions. I conduct Dual-RNA seq experiments to identify the genes involved in the response to infection and to observe the effects of different climates on infected plants. This aspect is particularly important for understanding how trees respond to diseases when exposed to changing climates, providing insights into the impacts of climate change on forest health.

# Research Interests

**Forest Pathology**
I investigate fungal disease processes and their impact on forest health, developing insights for sustainable disease management in forest ecosystems.

**Host-Pathogen Interaction**
I use dual RNA‑seq to examine host and pathogen transcriptomes simultaneously, elucidating molecular mechanisms of resistance and susceptibility, and assessing how climatic factors modulate these interactions.

**Fungal Genomics & Evolution**
I conduct comparative genomics of _Seiridium_ species and other fungi to uncover genetic determinants of pathogenicity and to investigate coevolutionary dynamics between hosts and pathogens.

**Molecular Ecology**
I study the diversity and ecological roles of airborne and wood-inhabiting fungal communities, using metabarcoding and phylogenetic approaches.

**Ancient DNA & Barcoding**
I extract and sequence DNA from historical herbarium specimens to reconstruct past fungal diversity and distribution, providing a temporal perspective on ecosystem change.

**Biocontrol Development**
I identify and test potential biological control agents for mitigating _Heterobasidion_ root rot in forests, integrating genomics and ecological data.

**Computational Biology**
As a passionate coder, I use high-performance computing on UC Berkeley’s [Savio](https://research-it.berkeley.edu/services-projects/high-performance-computing-savio) cluster to develop pipelines for transcriptomics, phylogenomics, and ecological data analyses 

# Research Projects

## Doctoral Research
My PhD research centers on the Cypress Canker Disease (CCD) pathosystem, investigating interactions between Seiridium cardinale and Cupressus sempervirens. Key research questions include:
- Which genes are associated with resistance in cypress to CCD?
- How does climate affect gene expression during infection?

I employ dual-RNA sequencing to analyze molecular interactions and evaluate how distinct climates influence these dynamics. My experimental setup spans multiple California climate zones, from coastal fog-influenced areas to inland Mediterranean climates with hot summers, providing insights on climate-related risks for tree health.
Complementing this, my comparative genomics analyses among Seiridium species explore evolutionary factors underpinning pathogenicity.
